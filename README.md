#Abstract
We investigate price and volatility risk originating in linkages between energy and agricultural 
commodity prices in Germany and study their dynamics over time. We propose an econometric approach 
to quantify the volatility and correlation risk structure, which has a large impact for investment 
and hedging strategies of market participants as well as for policy makers. Volatilities and their 
short and long run linkages are analyzed using an asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation GARCH 
model as well as a multivariate multiplicative volatility model. Our approach provides a flexible 
and accurate fitting procedure for volatility and correlation risk. We find that in the long run 
prices move together and preserve an equilibrium, while correlations are mostly positive with 
persistent market shocks. Our results reveal that concerns about biodiesel being the cause of 
high and volatile agricultural commodity prices are rather unjustified.
